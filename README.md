# Patron 

Patron is my C# implementations of common *Design Patterns*. It is purely for academic purposes and is not intended for production code.

The book Head First Design Patterns was used as a base.

NUnit is used for Testing.

#### Strategy Pattern
Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

#### Observer Pattern
Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
